PRaise — Celebrate Every Commit  
*Recognize. Reward. Raise the bar.*

##  Overview
Developers make countless contributions every day —commits, pull requests, issues, and stars but most go unnoticed.  
**PRaise** is an AI-powered milestone celebration system that automatically tracks GitHub activities and highlights every meaningful contribution.  

From the 10th PR merged to the 100th star earned, PRaise turns each achievement into a visual celebration through badges, dashboards, and milestone highlights — creating a culture of recognition and motivation across teams.

##  Problem Statement
Most organizations and open-source teams lack a unified way to **track or celebrate developer milestones** like commits, PRs, or repository stars.  
This leads to lower engagement, poor visibility, and unrecognized contributions within teams.

## ✅ Solution
PRaise connects directly to GitHub to detect important milestones, display them on a central dashboard, and celebrate them visually through badges and progress tracking.  
It brings visibility, motivation, and a sense of achievement to developer contributions.
